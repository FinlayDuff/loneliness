# A loneliness prescription index for the UK
This code is based on [an approach developed by the Office for National Statistics' Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/developing-a-loneliness-prescription-index/), which uses GP prescription data to find areas with above-average prescriptions for five conditions where loneliness has been shown to be a risk factor – Alzheimer’s, depression, high blood pressure, anxiety and insomnia.
